      "visible": "**4‑Step Plan to Back Up Phone Photos to a NAS**\n\n1. **Connect & Install**  \n   - Ensure your phone and NAS are on the same local network (Wi‑Fi or Ethernet).  \n   - Install a NAS‑compatible backup app (e.g., Syncthing, Google Photos → NAS, or the vendor’s app).\n\n2. **Create a Shared Folder on the NAS**  \n   - Log into the NAS admin UI.  \n   - Add a shared folder (e.g., `PhonePhotos`) and set appropriate permissions for read/write.\n\n3. **Configure the Backup App**  \n   - In the app, point the “source” to your phone’s photo library.  \n   - Set the destination to the NAS share you created.  \n   - Enable automatic sync or schedule (e.g., “continuous” or “daily at 2 AM”).\n\n4. **Verify & Maintain**  \n   - Run an initial full sync to confirm all photos appear on the NAS.",
