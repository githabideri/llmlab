# Overview

**llmlab** is a lightweight local‑LLM lab focused on reproducible configs and honest benchmarks.

Goals:
- Keep configs and results in one place
- Make performance comparisons repeatable
- Provide a minimal, realistic setup others can follow

What’s here:
- **Runbooks** for starting/stopping services
- **Benchmarks** with documented flags
- **Experiments** with goal/setup/metrics
- **Reasoning policy** (`docs/thinking-policy.md`)
- **LocalBot commands** (`docs/localbot.md`)

Current focus (Feb 2026): Nemotron A/B/C reasoning tuning and practical speed-vs-quality operating profiles.

What’s not here:
- Secrets, hostnames, IPs, or user‑specific paths
